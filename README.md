This is a project to build a system which can create cruise ships, create an itinerary of ports for them to travel to and allow them to dock at each port and then set sail to the next port. 
The aim of this project is to gain a better understanding of working with objects and to improve my knowledge of jest. Initially the project will be designed to only be used in the console but once it is completed a GUI will be created. 
There are 4 primary constructors in this project, these are: Ship, Port, Passengers & Itinerary. Each Itinerary will be an array of Port objects. The Ships methods will allow it to setSail from a port and to dock at a new Port. When these methods are called they will call the Port methods to either remove or add the Ship from the list of ships currently at the Port. If the ship is docked at a Port it will be able to get passengers. 
The tests for each contructor will be isolated. This will be achieved by using dummies, spies and stubs in my tests.
